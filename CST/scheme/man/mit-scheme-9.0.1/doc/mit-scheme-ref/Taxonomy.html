<h3 class="section">16.7 Condition-Type Taxonomy</h3>

<p>The MIT/GNU Scheme error system provides a rich set of predefined condition
types.  These are organized into a forest through taxonomic links
providing the relationships for &ldquo;specializes&rdquo; and &ldquo;generalizes&rdquo;. 
The chart appearing below shows these relationships by indenting all the
specializations of a given type relative to the type.  Note that the
variables that are bound to these condition types are prefixed by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">condition-type:</span></samp>&rsquo;; for example, the type appearing in the following
table as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">simple-error</span></samp>&rsquo; is stored in the variable
<code>condition-type:simple-error</code>.  Users are encouraged to add new
condition types by creating specializations of existing ones.

   <p>Following the chart are detailed descriptions of the predefined
condition types.  Some of these types are marked as <dfn>abstract</dfn>
types.  Abstract types are not intended to be used directly as the type
of a condition; they are to be used as generalizations of other types,
and for binding condition handlers.  Types that are not marked as
abstract are <dfn>concrete</dfn>; they are intended to be explicitly used as
a condition's type.

<blockquote><p>This is an abstract type.  It indicates that an error was generated by a
primitive procedure call.  Primitive procedures are distinguished from
ordinary procedures in that they are not written in Scheme but instead
in the underlying language of the Scheme implementation.  The

<blockquote><p>This is the most common condition type generated by primitive
procedures.  A condition of this type indicates that the primitive made
a system call to the operating system, and that the system call
signalled an error.  The system-call error is reflected back to Scheme
as a condition of this type, except that many common system-call errors
are automatically translated by the Scheme implementation into more
useful forms; for example, a system-call error that occurs while trying
to delete a file will be translated into a condition of type
<code>condition-type:file-operation-error</code>.  The <var>operator</var> field
contains the procedure that implements the operation (or a symbol naming
the procedure), and the <var>operands</var> field contains a list of the
arguments that were passed to the procedure.  The <var>system-call</var> and
<var>error-type</var> fields contain symbols that describe the specific
system call that was being made and the error that occurred,
respectively; these symbols are completely operating-system dependent.
