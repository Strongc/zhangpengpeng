<h2 class="chapter">1 Classes</h2>

<p><a name="index-class-1"></a><a name="index-instance-2"></a>A <dfn>class</dfn> is an object that determines the structure and behavior of
a set of other objects, which are called its <dfn>instances</dfn>.  However,
in this document, the word <dfn>instance</dfn> usually means an instance of
the class <code>&lt;instance&gt;</code>.

   <p><a name="index-subclass-3"></a><a name="index-superclass-4"></a>A class can inherit structure and behavior from other classes.  A class
whose definition refers to other classes for the purpose of inheriting
from them is said to be a <dfn>subclass</dfn> of each of those classes.  The
classes that are designated for purposes of inheritance are said to be
<dfn>superclasses</dfn> of the inheriting class.

   <p><a name="index-class-name-5"></a><a name="index-name_002c-of-class-6"></a>A class can have a <dfn>name</dfn>.  The procedure <code>class-name</code> takes a
class object and returns its name.  The name of an anonymous class is
<code>#f</code>.

   <p><a name="index-direct-superclass-7"></a><a name="index-superclass_002c-direct-8"></a><a name="index-direct-subclass-9"></a><a name="index-subclass_002c-direct-10"></a>A class <var>C_1</var> is a <dfn>direct superclass</dfn> of a class <var>C_2</var> if
<var>C_2</var> explicitly designates <var>C_1</var> as a superclass in its
definition.  In this case, <var>C_2</var> is a <dfn>direct subclass</dfn> of
<var>C_1</var>.  A class <var>C_n</var> is a <dfn>superclass</dfn> of a class <var>C_1</var>
if there exists a series of classes <var>C_2</var>, <small class="dots">...</small>, <var>C_n-1</var> such
that <var>C_i+1</var> is a direct superclass of <var>C_i</var> for all <var>i</var>
between <var>1</var> and <var>n</var>.  In this case, <var>C_1</var> is a
<dfn>subclass</dfn> of <var>C_n</var>.  A class is considered neither a superclass
nor a subclass of itself.  That is, if <var>C_1</var> is a superclass of
<var>C_2</var>, then <var>C_1</var> is different from <var>C_2</var>.  The set of
classes consisting of some given class <var>C</var> along with all of its
superclasses is called &ldquo;<var>C</var> and its superclasses.&rdquo;

   <p><a name="index-class-precedence-list-11"></a><a name="index-precedence-list_002c-class-12"></a>Each class has a <dfn>class precedence list</dfn>, which is a total ordering
on the set of the given class and its superclasses.  The total ordering
is expressed as a list ordered from the most specific to the least
specific.  The class precedence list is used in several ways.  In
general, more specific classes can <dfn>shadow</dfn>, or override, features
that would otherwise be inherited from less specific classes.  The
method selection and combination process uses the class precedence list
to order methods from most specific to least specific.

   <p><a name="index-local-precedence-order-13"></a><a name="index-precedence-order_002c-local-14"></a><a name="index-order_002c-local-precedence-15"></a>When a class is defined, the order in which its direct superclasses are
mentioned in the defining form is important.  Each class has a
<dfn>local precedence order</dfn>, which is a list consisting of the class
followed by its direct superclasses in the order mentioned in the
defining form.

   <p>A class precedence list is always consistent with the local precedence
order of each class in the list.  The classes in each local precedence
order appear within the class precedence list in the same order.  If the
local precedence orders are inconsistent with each other, no class
precedence list can be constructed, and an error is signalled.

   <p>Classes are organized into a <dfn>directed acyclic graph</dfn>.  There are
two distinguished classes, named <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;instance&gt;</code>. 
The class named <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> has no superclasses.  It is a superclass
of every class except itself.  The class named <code>&lt;instance&gt;</code> is a
direct subclass of <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> and is the base class for
<dfn>instance</dfn> objects.  Instances are special because <span class="sc">sos</span> has
efficient mechanisms for dispatching on them and for accessing their
slots.
