<h3 class="section">2.8 Leaving Scheme</h3>

<p>There are several ways that you can leave Scheme: there are two Scheme
procedures that you can call; there are several Edwin commands that you
can execute; and there are graphical-interface buttons (and their
associated keyboard accelerators) that you can activate.

     <ul>
<li><em>Two Scheme procedures that you can call.</em>  The first is to
evaluate

     <p><a name="index-exit-83"></a>
     <pre class="example">          (exit)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which will halt the Scheme system, after first requesting confirmation. 
Any information that was in the environment is lost, so this should not
be done lightly.

     <p>The second procedure suspends Scheme; when this is done you may later
restart where you left off.  Unfortunately this is not possible in all
operating systems; currently it works under unix versions that support
job control (i.e. all of the unix versions for which we distribute
Scheme).  To suspend Scheme, evaluate

     <p><a name="index-quit-84"></a>
     <pre class="example">          (quit)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If your system supports suspension, this will cause Scheme to stop, and
you will be returned to the shell.  Scheme remains stopped, and can be
continued using the job-control commands of your shell.  If your system
doesn't support suspension, this procedure does nothing.  (Calling the
<code>quit</code> procedure is analogous to typing <kbd>C-z</kbd>, but it allows
Scheme to respond by typing a prompt when it is unsuspended.)

     <li><em>Several Edwin commands that you can execute,</em> including
<code>save-buffers-kill-scheme</code>, normally bound to <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>, and
<code>suspend-scheme</code>, normally bound to <kbd>C-x C-z</kbd>.  These two
commands correspond to the procedures <code>exit</code> and <code>quit</code>,
respectively.

     <li><em>Graphical-interface buttons that you can activate.</em>  Under
Windows, closing the console window (Scheme's main window) causes
Scheme to be terminated.  Under any operating system, closing an Edwin
window causes that window to go away, and if it is the only Edwin
window, it terminates Scheme as well. 
</ul>
