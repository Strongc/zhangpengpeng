<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 The Prompt and Level Number</h4>

<p><a name="index-prompt_002c-REPL-86"></a>The <acronym>REPL</acronym> <dfn>prompt</dfn> normally has the form

<pre class="example">     1 ]=&gt;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-level-number_002c-REPL-87"></a>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; in the prompt is a <dfn>level number</dfn>, which is always a
positive integer.  This number is incremented under certain
circumstances, the most common being an error.  For example, here is
what you will see if you type <kbd>f o o &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> after starting
Scheme:

<pre class="example">     ;Unbound variable: foo
     ;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
     ; (RESTART 3) =&gt; Specify a value to use instead of foo.
     ; (RESTART 2) =&gt; Define foo to a given value.
     ; (RESTART 1) =&gt; Return to read-eval-print level 1.
     
     2 error&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, the level number has been incremented to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
indicates that a new <acronym>REPL</acronym> has been started (also the prompt
string has been changed to remind you that the <acronym>REPL</acronym> was
started because of an error).  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo; means that this new
<acronym>REPL</acronym> is &ldquo;over&rdquo; the old one.  The original <acronym>REPL</acronym>
still exists, and is waiting for you to return to it, for example, by
entering &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(restart 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Furthermore, if an error occurs while you
are in this <acronym>REPL</acronym>, yet another <acronym>REPL</acronym> will be started,
and the level number will be increased to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This can continue
ad infinitum, but normally it is rare to use more than a few levels.

   <p>The normal way to get out of an error <acronym>REPL</acronym> and back to the top
level <acronym>REPL</acronym> is to use the <kbd>C-g</kbd> interrupt.  This is a
single-keystroke command executed by holding down the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and
pressing the &lt;G&gt; key.  <kbd>C-g</kbd> always terminates whatever is
running and returns you to the top level <acronym>REPL</acronym> immediately.

   <p>Note: The appearance of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">error&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt does not mean that
Scheme is in some weird inconsistent state that you should avoid.  It is
merely a reminder that your program was in error: an illegal operation
was attempted, but it was detected and avoided.  Often the best way to
find out what is in error is to do some poking around in the error
<acronym>REPL</acronym>.  If you abort out of it, the context of the error will
be destroyed, and you may not be able to find out what happened.
