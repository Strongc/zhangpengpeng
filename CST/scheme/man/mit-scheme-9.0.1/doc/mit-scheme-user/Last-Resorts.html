<p>When Scheme exits abnormally it tries to save any unsaved Edwin buffers. 
The buffers are saved in an auto-save file in case the original is more
valuable than the unsaved version.  You can use the editor command
<kbd>M-x recover-file</kbd> to recover the auto-saved version.  The name
used to specify an auto-save file is operating-system dependent: under
unix, and on PC file systems with long file names, <samp><span class="file">foo.scm</span></samp> will
be saved as <samp><span class="file">#foo.scm#</span></samp>; on PC file systems with short file names,
it will be saved as <samp><span class="file">foo.sav</span></samp>.

   <p>The following Scheme procedures are useful for recovering from bugs in
Edwin's implementation.  All of them are designed for use when Edwin is
<em>not</em> running&mdash;they should not be used when Edwin is running. 
These procedures are designed to help Edwin's implementors deal with
bugs during the implementation of the editor; they are not intended for
casual use, but as a means of recovering from bugs that would otherwise
require reloading the editor's world image from the disk.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; procedure: <b>save-editor-files</b><var><a name="index-save_002deditor_002dfiles-285"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Examines Edwin, offering to save any unsaved buffers.  This is useful if
some bug caused Edwin to die while there were unsaved buffers, and you
want to save the information without restarting the editor. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; procedure: <b>reset-editor</b><var><a name="index-reset_002deditor-286"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Resets Edwin, causing it to be reinitialized the next time that
<code>edit</code> is called.  If you encounter a fatal bug in Edwin, a good
way to recover is to first call <code>save-editor-files</code>, and then to
call <code>reset-editor</code>.  That should completely reset the editor to
its initial state. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; procedure: <b>reset-editor-windows</b><var><a name="index-reset_002deditor_002dwindows-287"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Resets Edwin's display structures, without affecting any of the buffers
or their contents.  This is useful if a bug in the display code causes
Edwin's internal display data structures to get into an inconsistent
state that prevents Edwin from running. 
</p></blockquote></div>
