<h3 class="section">4.6 Sending Replies</h3>

<p><acronym>IMAIL</acronym> has several commands that use Mail mode to send outgoing
mail.  What this section documents are the special commands of
<acronym>IMAIL</acronym> for entering Mail mode.  Note that the usual keys for
sending mail&mdash;<kbd>C-x m</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, and <kbd>C-x 5 m</kbd>&mdash;are
available in <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> mode and work just as they usually do.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Send a message (<code>imail-mail</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>c</kbd><dd>Continue editing the already started outgoing message (<code>imail-continue</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Send a reply to the current <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> message (<code>imail-reply</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Forward the current message to other users (<code>imail-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u f</kbd><dd>Resend the current message to other users (<code>imail-resend</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-r-178"></a><a name="index-imail_002dreply-179"></a><a name="index-reply-to-a-message-180"></a>The most common reason to send a message while in <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> is to
reply to the message you are reading.  To do this, type <kbd>r</kbd>
(<code>imail-reply</code>).  This displays the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer in another
window, much like <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, but preinitializes the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">In-reply-to</span></samp>&rsquo; header fields based on the
message you are replying to.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>&rsquo; field starts out as the
address of the person who sent the message you received, and the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>&rsquo; field starts out with all the other recipients of that
message.

   <p><a name="index-imail_002ddont_002dreply_002dto_002dnames-181"></a><a name="index-imail_002ddefault_002ddont_002dreply_002dto_002dnames-182"></a>You can exclude certain recipients from being placed automatically in
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>&rsquo;, using the variable <code>imail-dont-reply-to-names</code>.  Its
value should be a regular expression (as a string); any recipient that
the regular expression matches is excluded from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>&rsquo; field. 
The default value matches your own name, and any name starting with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info-</span></samp>&rsquo; (the value of the variable
<code>imail-default-dont-reply-to-names</code>).  (Those names are excluded
because there is a convention of using them for large mailing lists to
broadcast announcements.)

   <p>To omit the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>&rsquo; field completely for a particular reply, enter
the reply command with a numeric argument: <kbd>C-u r</kbd> or <kbd>1 r</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-imail_002dreply_002dwith_002dre-183"></a>By default, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>&rsquo; field of a reply is initialized to the
contents of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>&rsquo; field of the message being replied to. 
However, if the variable <code>imail-reply-with-re</code> is set to <code>#t</code>,
then the reply subject will be prefixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Re:</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Once the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer has been initialized, editing and sending
the mail goes as usual.  You can edit the presupplied header fields if
they are not right for you.  You can also use the commands of Mail mode,
including <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd> which yanks in the message that you are replying
to.  You can switch to the <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> buffer, select a different
message there, switch back, and yank the new current message.

   <p><a name="index-f-184"></a><a name="index-imail_002dforward-185"></a><a name="index-forwarding-a-message-186"></a>Another frequent reason to send mail in <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> is to
<dfn>forward</dfn> the current message to other users.  <kbd>f</kbd>
(<code>imail-forward</code>) makes this easy by preinitializing the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer with the current message as a <acronym>MIME</acronym>
attachment, and a subject designating a forwarded message.  All you have
to do is fill in the recipients and send.  When you forward a message,
recipients get a message which is &ldquo;from&rdquo; you, and which has the
original message in its contents.

   <p><a name="index-imail_002dforward_002dusing_002dmime-187"></a>By default, forwarded messages are sent as <acronym>MIME</acronym> attachments,
which allows <acronym>MIME</acronym>-aware mail readers to recognize that the
attachment is a mail message and to specially present it.  However, this
means that such forwarded messages appear more complex when viewed in
mail readers that do not understand <acronym>MIME</acronym>.  <acronym>IMAIL</acronym>
deliberately minimizes the amount of encoding overhead used for
<acronym>MIME</acronym>-forwarded messages, but some people prefer not to use
<acronym>MIME</acronym> at all.  For that reason, <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> allows you to
turn off this feature, so that forwarded messages are included in the
main body of the message (as Rmail does).  To do this, set the variable
<code>imail-forward-using-mime</code> to <code>#f</code>.

   <p><a name="index-imail_002dforward_002dall_002dheaders-188"></a>Normally, when <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> forwards a message, it sends only a few
of the message's header fields.  In particular, it sends only those
header fields that you see when viewing the message in <acronym>IMAIL</acronym>. 
Sometimes it is desirable to send <em>all</em> of the message's header
fields; <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> provides two ways to do this.  First, if you
want to send all of the header fields for a particular message, use
<code>imail-forward</code> with a negative argument, like this: <kbd>- f</kbd>. 
Alternatively, you can set the variable <code>imail-forward-all-headers</code>
to <code>#t</code>, which will cause <em>all</em> forwarded messages to retain
all of their header fields.

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-f-189"></a><a name="index-imail_002dresend-190"></a><dfn>Resending</dfn> is an alternative similar to forwarding; the difference
is that resending sends a message that is &ldquo;from&rdquo; the original sender,
just as it reached you&mdash;with a few added header fields
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Resent-from</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Resent-to</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate that it came via
you.  To resend a message in <acronym>IMAIL</acronym>, use <kbd>C-u f</kbd>.  (<kbd>f</kbd>
runs <code>imail-forward</code>, which is programmed to invoke
<code>imail-resend</code> if you provide a numeric argument.)

   <p><a name="index-m-191"></a><a name="index-imail_002dmail-192"></a>The <kbd>m</kbd> (<code>imail-mail</code>) command is used to start editing an
outgoing message that is not a reply.  It leaves the header fields
empty.  Its only difference from <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd> is that it makes the
<acronym>IMAIL</acronym> buffer accessible for <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>, just as <kbd>r</kbd>
does.  Thus, <kbd>m</kbd> can be used to reply to or forward a message.

   <p><a name="index-c-193"></a><a name="index-imail_002dcontinue-194"></a>The <kbd>c</kbd> (<code>imail-continue</code>) command resumes editing the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, to finish editing an outgoing message you were
already composing, or to alter a message you have sent.
