<h3 class="section">4.2 Deleting Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-deletion-73"></a>When you no longer need to keep a message, you can <dfn>delete</dfn> it. 
This flags it as ignorable, and some <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> commands pretend it
is no longer present; but it still has its place in the <acronym>IMAIL</acronym>
folder, and still has its message number.

   <p><a name="index-expunging-74"></a><dfn>Expunging</dfn> the <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> folder actually removes the deleted
messages.  The remaining messages are renumbered consecutively. 
Expunging is the only action that changes the message number of any
message.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Delete the current message, and move to the next nondeleted message
(<code>imail-delete-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Delete the current message, and move to the previous nondeleted
message (<code>imail-delete-backward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Undelete the current message, or move back to a deleted message and
undelete it (<code>imail-undelete-previous-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Expunge the <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> folder (<code>imail-expunge</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-75"></a><a name="index-imail_002ddelete_002dforward-76"></a><a name="index-C_002dd-77"></a><a name="index-imail_002ddelete_002dbackward-78"></a>There are two <acronym>IMAIL</acronym> commands for deleting messages.  Both
delete the current message and select another message.  <kbd>d</kbd>
(<code>imail-delete-forward</code>) moves to the following message, skipping
messages already deleted, while <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>imail-delete-backward</code>)
moves to the previous nondeleted message.  If there is no nondeleted
message to move to in the specified direction, the message that was just
deleted remains current.  A numeric argument to either command reverses
the direction of motion after deletion.

   <p><a name="index-undeletion-79"></a><a name="index-x-80"></a><a name="index-imail_002dexpunge-81"></a><a name="index-u-82"></a><a name="index-imail_002dundelete_002dprevious_002dmessage-83"></a>To make all the deleted messages finally vanish from the <acronym>IMAIL</acronym>
folder, type <kbd>x</kbd> (<code>imail-expunge</code>).  Until you do this, you can
still <dfn>undelete</dfn> the deleted messages.  The undeletion command,
<kbd>u</kbd> (<code>imail-undelete-previous-message</code>), is designed to cancel
the effect of a <kbd>d</kbd> command in most cases.  It undeletes the current
message if the current message is deleted.  Otherwise it moves backward
to previous messages until a deleted message is found, and undeletes
that message.

   <p><a name="index-imail_002dexpunge_002dconfirmation-84"></a>Because <code>imail-expunge</code> irreversibly deletes mail, <acronym>IMAIL</acronym>
normally requires confirmation before it performs the expunge.  This
confirmation is controlled by the value of the variable
<code>imail-expunge-confirmation</code>, which is a list of symbols.  There
are two independent behaviors controlled by this: whether to prompt, and
whether to show the messages being expunged.  If the list contains the
symbol <code>verbose</code> (the default), the user is prompted for a
yes-or-no style confirmation; if the list contains the symbol
<code>brief</code>, the user is prompted for a y-or-n style confirmation; if
neither of these symbols is present, no confirmation is done.  If the
list contains the symbol <code>show-messages</code>, a window is popped up
showing the messages to be expunged; otherwise the list is not shown.

   <p>You can usually undo a <kbd>d</kbd> with a <kbd>u</kbd> because the <kbd>u</kbd> moves
back to and undeletes the message that the <kbd>d</kbd> deleted.  But this
does not work when the <kbd>d</kbd> skips a few already-deleted messages that
follow the message being deleted; then the <kbd>u</kbd> command undeletes the
last of the messages that were skipped.  There is no clean way to avoid
this problem.  However, by repeating the <kbd>u</kbd> command, you can
eventually get back to the message that you intend to undelete.  You can
also select a particular deleted message with the <kbd>M-p</kbd> command,
then type <kbd>u</kbd> to undelete it.

   <p>A deleted message has the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>&rsquo; flag, and as a result
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in the mode line when the current message is
deleted.  In fact, deleting or undeleting a message is nothing more than
adding or removing this flag.  See <a href="Flags.html#Flags">Flags</a>.
