<h3 class="section">7.6 The Edwin Debugger</h3>

<p>The Edwin debugger is similar to the command-line debugger, except that
it takes advantage of multiple windows and Edwin's command structure to
provide a more intuitive interface.  The debugger operates as a browser,
much like Dired, presenting you with an overview of the subproblem
structure, and allowing you to examine parts of that structure in more
detail by selecting the parts.  When started, the debugger creates a
buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*debug*</span></samp>&rsquo; showing the subproblem structure, and selects the
first line.

   <p>Each line beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; represents either a subproblem or
stack frame.  A subproblem line may be followed by one or more indented
lines (beginning with the letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;) which represent reductions
associated with that subproblem.  The subproblems are indexed with the
natural numbers.  To obtain a more complete description of a subproblem
or reduction, click the mouse on the desired line or move the cursor to
the line using the arrow keys (or <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd>).  The
description buffer will display the additional information.

   <p>The description buffer contains three major regions.  The first region
contains a pretty-printed version of the current expression.  The
current subproblem within the expression is highlighted.  The second
region contains a representation of the frames of the environment of the
current expression.  The bindings of each frame are listed below the
frame header.  If there are no bindings in the frame, none will be
listed.  The frame of the current expression is preceded with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">==&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The bottom of the description buffer contains a third region for
evaluating expressions in the environment of the selected subproblem or
reduction.  This is the only portion of the buffer where editing is
possible.  This region can be used to find the values of variables in
different environments, or even to modify variable values or data
structures (note that variables in compiled code cannot usually be
modified).

   <p>Typing <kbd>e</kbd> creates a new buffer in which you may browse through the
current environment.  In this new buffer, you can use the mouse, the
arrows, or <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> to select lines and view different
environments.  The environments listed are the same as those in the
description buffer.  If the selected environment structure is too large
to display (i.e. if the number of bindings in the environment exceeds
the value of the editor variable <code>environment-package-limit</code>) a
message to that effect is displayed.  To display the environment in this
case, use <kbd>M-x set-variable</kbd> to set <code>environment-package-limit</code>
to <code>#f</code>.  At the bottom of the new buffer is a region for
evaluating expressions, similar to that of the description buffer.

   <p>The appearance of environment displays is controlled by the editor
variables <code>debugger-show-inner-frame-topmost?</code> and
<code>debugger-compact-display?</code>  which affect the ordering of
environment frames and the line spacing respectively.

   <p>Type <kbd>q</kbd> to quit the debugger, killing its primary buffer, any
others that it has created, and the window that was popped up to show
the debugger.

   <p><strong>Note</strong>: The description buffers created by the debugger are given
names beginning with spaces so that they do not appear in the buffer
list; these buffers are automatically deleted when you quit the
debugger.  If you wish to keep one of these buffers, simply rename it
using <kbd>M-x rename-buffer</kbd>: once it has been renamed, it will not be
automatically deleted.
