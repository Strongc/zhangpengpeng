<h3 class="section">2.4 Command-Line Options</h3>

<p>Scheme accepts the command-line options detailed in the following
sections.  The options may appear in any order, with the restriction
that the microcode options must appear before the runtime options, and
the runtime options must appear before any other arguments on the
command line.  Any arguments other than these options will generate a
warning message when Scheme starts.  If you want to define your own
command-line options, see <a href="Custom-Command_002dline-Options.html#Custom-Command_002dline-Options">Custom Command-line Options</a>.

   <p>Note that MIT/GNU Scheme supports only <dfn>long</dfn> options, that
is, options specified by verbose names, as opposed to <dfn>short</dfn>
options, which are specified by single characters.  As of release 7.7.90,
all options start with two hyphens, for compatibility with GNU
coding standards (and most modern programs).  Prior to this release,
options started with a single hyphen.  While the single-hyphen style
continues to work, it is deprecated and will someday stop working.

   <p>These are the microcode options:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--band </span><var>filename</var></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dband-26"></a><a name="index-MITSCHEME_005fBAND-27"></a><a name="index-world-image-28"></a><a name="index-band-29"></a>Specifies the initial world image file (<dfn>band</dfn>) to be loaded. 
Searches for <var>filename</var> in the working directory and the library
directories, using the full pathname of the first readable file of
that name.  If <var>filename</var> is an absolute pathname (on unix, this
means it starts with <samp><span class="file">/</span></samp>), then no search occurs&mdash;<var>filename</var>
is tested for readability and then used directly.  If this option
isn't given, the filename is the value of the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">MITSCHEME_BAND</span></samp>, or if that isn't defined, <samp><span class="file">all.com</span></samp>; in
these cases the library directories are searched, but not the working
directory.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--heap </span><var>blocks</var></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dheap-30"></a>Specifies the size of the heap in 1024-word blocks.  Overrides any
default.  The size specified by this option is incremented by the
amount of heap space needed by the band being loaded.  Consequently,
<samp><span class="option">--heap</span></samp> specifies how much free space will be available in the
heap when Scheme starts, independent of the amount of heap already
consumed by the band.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--constant </span><var>blocks</var></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dconstant-31"></a>Specifies the size of constant space in 1024-word blocks.  Overrides any
default.  Constant space holds the compiled code for the runtime system
and other subsystems.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--stack </span><var>blocks</var></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dstack-32"></a>Specifies the size of the stack in 1024-word blocks.  Overrides any
default.  This is Scheme's stack, <em>not</em> the unix stack used by C
programs.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--option-summary</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002doption_002dsummary-33"></a>Causes Scheme to write an option summary to standard error.  This
shows the values of all of the settable microcode option variables.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--emacs</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002demacs-34"></a>Specifies that Scheme is running as a subprocess of GNU Emacs.  This
option is automatically supplied by GNU Emacs, and should not be given
under other circumstances.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--interactive</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dinteractive-35"></a>If this option isn't specified, and Scheme's standard <acronym>I/O</acronym> is
not a terminal, Scheme will detach itself from its controlling
terminal, which prevents it from getting signals sent to the process
group of that terminal.  If this option is specified, Scheme will not
detach itself from the controlling terminal.

     <p>This detaching behavior is useful for running Scheme as a background
job.  For example, using Bourne shell, the following will run Scheme
as a background job, redirecting its input and output to files, and
preventing it from being killed by keyboard interrupts or by logging
out:

     <pre class="example">          mit-scheme &lt; /usr/cph/foo.in &gt; /usr/cph/foo.out 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
</pre>
     <p>This option is ignored under non-unix operating systems.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--nocore</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dnocore-36"></a>Specifies that Scheme should not generate a core dump under any
circumstances.  If this option is not given, and Scheme terminates
abnormally, you will be prompted to decide whether a core dump should be
generated.

     <p>This option is ignored under non-unix operating systems.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--library </span><var>path</var></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dlibrary-37"></a><a name="index-MITSCHEME_005fLIBRARY_005fPATH-38"></a>Sets the library search path to <var>path</var>.  This is a
list of directories that is searched to find various library files, such
as bands.  If this option is not given, the value of the environment
variable <samp><span class="env">MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> is used; if that isn't defined,
the default is used.

     <p>On unix, the elements of the list are separated by colons, and the
default value is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-</span><var>ARCH</var></samp>.  On PCs,
the elements of the list are separated by semicolons, and the default
value is <samp><span class="file">c:\local\mit-scheme</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--fasl </span><var>filename</var></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dfasl-39"></a>Specifies that a <dfn>cold load</dfn> should be performed, using
<var>filename</var> as the initial file to be loaded.  If this option isn't
given, a normal load is performed instead.  This option may not be
used together with the <samp><span class="option">--band</span></samp> option.  This option is useful
only for maintenance and development of the MIT/GNU Scheme runtime
system. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The following options are runtime options.  They are processed after the
microcode options and after the image file is loaded.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--no-init-file</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dno_002dinit_002dfile-40"></a>This option causes Scheme to ignore the <samp><span class="file">${HOME}/.scheme.init</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">scheme.ini</span></samp> file, normally loaded automatically when Scheme starts
(if it exists).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--suspend-file</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dsuspend_002dfile-41"></a>Under some circumstances Scheme can write out a file called
<samp><span class="file">scheme_suspend</span></samp> in the user's home directory.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> This file is a world image containing the
complete state of the Scheme process; restoring this file continues the
computation that Scheme was performing at the time the file was written.

     <p>Normally this file is never written, but the <samp><span class="option">--suspend-file</span></samp>
option enables writing of this file.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--eval </span><var>expression</var><span class="option"> ...</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002deval-42"></a>This option causes Scheme to evaluate the <var>expression</var>s following it
on the command line, up to (but not including) the next argument that
starts with a hyphen.  The expressions are evaluated in the
<code>user-initial-environment</code>.  Unless explicitly handled, errors
during evaluation are silently ignored.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--load </span><var>file</var><span class="option"> ...</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dload-43"></a>This option causes Scheme to load the <var>file</var>s (or lists of files)
following it on the command line, up to (but not including) the next
argument that starts with a hyphen.  The files are loaded in the
<code>user-initial-environment</code>.  Unless explicitly handled, errors
during loading are silently ignored. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The following option is supported only when Edwin is loaded.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--edit</span></samp><dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dedit-44"></a>This option causes Edwin to start immediately when Scheme is started. 
</dl>
