<h3 class="section">7.5 REPL Mode</h3>

<p>Edwin provides a special mechanism for interacting with Scheme
read-eval-print loops: <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffers.  A <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer
is associated with a Scheme <acronym>REPL</acronym> running in a separate thread
of execution; because of this, expressions may be evaluated in this
buffer while you simultaneously do other things with the editor.  A
<acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer captures all printed output from an evaluated
expression, as well as supporting interactive programs such as
<code>debug</code>.  For these and other reasons, <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffers are
the preferred means for interacting with the Scheme interpreter.

   <p>When Edwin starts, it has one buffer: a <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*scheme*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The command <kbd>M-x repl</kbd> selects this buffer, if it
exists; otherwise it creates a new <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer.  If you want
two <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffers, just rename the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*scheme*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer to
something else and run <kbd>M-x repl</kbd> again.

   <p><acronym>REPL</acronym> buffers support all the same evaluation commands that
Scheme mode does; in fact, <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffers use a special mode
called <acronym>REPL</acronym> mode that inherits from Scheme mode.  Thus, any
key bindings defined in Scheme mode are also defined in <acronym>REPL</acronym>
mode.  One exception to this is the <kbd>M-o</kbd> command, which is
deliberately undefined in <acronym>REPL</acronym> mode; otherwise it would be too
easy to re-evaluate all the previously evaluated expressions in the
<acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer.

   <p>In addition to evaluation commands, <acronym>REPL</acronym> mode provides a
handful of special commands for controlling the <acronym>REPL</acronym> itself. 
The commands <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c C-u</kbd> abort the current
evaluation, returning to the current or previous <acronym>REPL</acronym> levels,
respectively.  The command <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> interrupts the current
evaluation, entering a breakpoint.

   <p>Each <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer maintains a history of the expressions that
were typed into it.  Several commands allow you to access the contents
of this history.  The command <kbd>M-p</kbd> moves backwards through the
history, inserting previously evaluated expressions at point.  Likewise,
<kbd>M-n</kbd> moves forward through the history.  The commands <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd>
and <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> search backward and forward through the history for a
particular string.  The command <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd> deletes any output from
the previous evaluation; use this command with care since it cannot be
undone.  The command <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> finds the most recent expression in
the buffer and moves point there.

   <p>When an expression that you evaluate signals an error, the
<acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer notices this and offers to run the debugger for
you.  Answer this question with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; response.  You
can start the debugger whenever the <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer is listening
by executing the <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> command.  In either case, this starts the
Edwin debugger, which pops up a new window containing the debugger. 
Your <acronym>REPL</acronym> buffer remains in the error state, allowing you to
examine it further if you wish.
