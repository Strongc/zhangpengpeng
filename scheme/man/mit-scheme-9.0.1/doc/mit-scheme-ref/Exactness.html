<h3 class="section">4.2 Exactness</h3>

<p><a name="index-exactness-436"></a>
Scheme numbers are either <em>exact</em> or <em>inexact</em>.  A number is
exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from exact
numbers using only exact operations.  A number is inexact if it was
written as an inexact constant, if it was derived using inexact
ingredients, or if it was derived using inexact operations. Thus
inexactness is a contagious property of a number.

   <p>If two implementations produce exact results for a computation that did
not involve inexact intermediate results, the two ultimate results will
be mathematically equivalent.  This is generally not true of
computations involving inexact numbers since approximate methods such as
floating point arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of each
implementation to make the result as close as practical to the
mathematically ideal result.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002b-437"></a>Rational operations such as <code>+</code> should always produce exact results
when given exact arguments.  If the operation is unable to produce an
exact result, then it may either report the violation of an
implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an
inexact value.  See <a href="Implementation-restrictions.html#Implementation-restrictions">Implementation restrictions</a>.

   <p><a name="index-inexact_002d_003eexact-438"></a>With the exception of <code>inexact-&gt;exact</code>, the operations described in
this section must generally return inexact results when given any
inexact arguments.  An operation may, however, return an exact result if
it can prove that the value of the result is unaffected by the
inexactness of its arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number
by an exact zero may produce an exact zero result, even if the other
argument is inexact.
