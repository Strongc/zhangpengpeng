<h3 class="section">14.9 Port Primitives</h3>

<p><a name="index-port-primitives-2146"></a>
This section describes the low-level operations that can be used to
build and manipulate <acronym>I/O</acronym> ports.

   <p>The purpose of these operations is twofold: to allow programmers to
construct new kinds of <acronym>I/O</acronym> ports, and to provide faster
<acronym>I/O</acronym> operations than those supplied by the standard high
level procedures.  The latter is useful because the standard
<acronym>I/O</acronym> operations provide defaulting and error checking, and
sometimes other features, which are often unnecessary.  This interface
provides the means to bypass such features, thus improving
performance.

   <p>The abstract model of an <acronym>I/O</acronym> port, as implemented here, is a
combination of a set of named operations and a state.  The state is an
arbitrary object, the meaning of which is determined by the
operations.  The operations are defined by a mapping from names to
procedures.

   <p><a name="index-port-type-2147"></a>The set of named operations is represented by an object called a
<dfn>port type</dfn>.  A port type is constructed from a set of named
operations, and is subsequently used to construct a port.  The port type
completely specifies the behavior of the port.  Port types also support
a simple form of inheritance, allowing you to create new ports that are
similar to existing ports.

   <p>The port operations are divided into two classes:

     <dl>
<dt>Standard operations<dd>There is a specific set of standard operations for input ports, and a
different set for output ports.  Applications can assume that the
standard input operations are implemented for all input ports, and
likewise the standard output operations are implemented for all output
ports. 
<a name="index-standard-operations_002c-on-port-2148"></a>
<br><dt>Custom operations<dd>Some ports support additional operations.  For example, ports that
implement output to terminals (or windows) may define an operation named
<code>y-size</code> that returns the height of the terminal in characters. 
Because only some ports will implement these operations, programs that
use custom operations must test each port for their existence, and be
prepared to deal with ports that do not implement them.
