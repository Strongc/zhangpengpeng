<h4 class="subsection">1.2.6 External Representations</h4>

<p><a name="index-external-representation-_0028defn_0029-105"></a><a name="index-representation_002c-external-_0028defn_0029-106"></a>An important concept in Scheme is that of the
<dfn>external representation</dfn> of an object as a sequence of characters. 
For example, an external representation of the integer 28 is the
sequence of characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">28</span></samp>&rsquo;, and an external representation of a
list consisting of the integers 8 and 13 is the sequence of characters
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(8 13)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The external representation of an object is not necessarily unique.  The
integer 28 also has representations &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#e28.000</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#x1c</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
the list in the previous paragraph also has the representations &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(
08 13 )</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(8 . (13 . ( )))</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Many objects have standard external representations, but some, such as
procedures and circular data structures, do not have standard
representations (although particular implementations may define
representations for them).

   <p>An external representation may be written in a program to obtain the
corresponding object (see <a href="Quoting.html#Quoting">Quoting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-read-107"></a><a name="index-write-108"></a>External representations can also be used for input and output.  The
procedure <code>read</code> parses external representations, and the procedure
<code>write</code> generates them.  Together, they provide an elegant and
powerful input/output facility.

   <p>Note that the sequence of characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(+ 2 6)</span></samp>&rsquo; is <em>not</em> an
external representation of the integer 8, even though it <em>is</em> an
expression that evaluates to the integer 8; rather, it is an external
representation of a three-element list, the elements of which are the
symbol <code>+</code> and the integers <code>2</code> and <code>6</code>.  Scheme's syntax
has the property that any sequence of characters that is an expression
is also the external representation of some object.  This can lead to
confusion, since it may not be obvious out of context whether a given
sequence of characters is intended to denote data or program, but it is
also a source of power, since it facilitates writing programs such as
interpreters and compilers that treat programs as data or data as
programs.
